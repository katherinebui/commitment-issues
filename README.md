Do you ever feel like you are spreading yourself too thin?
Do you ever feel the guilt for forgetting the important thing?
Do you fear that you have commitment issues?
Do you ever fear that when you make a mistake, there's no going back?

HAVE NO FEAR! I HAVE BUILT THE SOULTION FOR YOU.

With Commitment-Issues, you can set our work hours and a timer to have a text sent to your phone to reminder you to commit your work to GitHub!
